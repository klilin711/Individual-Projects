All models are located in the COMP30027_2024_asst2.ipynb file, with each 
model section clearly listed in bold for easy navigation. The order in which 
the models are run is as follows: 0R, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

You can find the results for each model in their corresponding sections 
within the notebook. Each section includes the model's predictions on 
the test datasets in Kaggle format.

For 0R, it includes the prediction file: test_dataset_zeroR.csv
For Decision Trees, it includes two prediction files: test_dataset_dt_before tuning.csv and test_dataset_dt_after tuning.csv.
For Random Forests, it also includes two prediction files: test_dataset_rf_before tuning.csv and test_dataset_rf_after tuning.csv.
